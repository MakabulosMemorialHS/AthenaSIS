-- Work restarted on this project. Too busy during the last few days.

-- Need to find a UML modeller for Ubuntu. Actually, a simple ERD diagram
   editor would do. Any suggestions?

-- I have decided to use the same schema being used by ISIS but with
   modifications. ISIS has two databases, permanent, and accounting but
   experience suggests it is better to combine this two into one database
   but with the same tables.

-- I used pg_dump to dump the schema of permanent and accounting.

-- Start work on Athena SIS.

-- First item that needs to be accomplished is to test ability of
   the version of Qt currently installed to access a PostgreSQL server.

-- Explore possibility of using French to write these NOTES.

-- Documentation suggests that the libqt4-sql package should be installed
   if one wishes to acquire integration with SQL databases. This package is
   included in my install.
