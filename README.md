# AthenaSIS
Athena Student Information System

AthenaSIS shall be the second iteration of the Integrated Student Information System (ISIS) project.
ISIS as an acronym is not very popular nowadays so I have renamed the new version of the
project to Athena Student Information System. Athena is a sister goddess of Isis, hence
the name.

ISIS is a very successful project at the MMHS. However, its target host is a Linux
system and the PostgreSQL database is also served from a Linux server. ISIS uses a mix of
Python, C, and C++ programs all of which work together to provide a responsive
information system that is accessible by students (through the SOA facility) and
staff.

This document serves only as an announcement.
